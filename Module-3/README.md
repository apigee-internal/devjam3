# Module 3 - Advanced API Management Part 1

In Apigee’s API Jam [Module 1](../Module-1), we saw how to suppor the overal API lifecycle management for your APIs with Apigee Edge.
This module - Apigee’s API Jam Module 3 - is the first part of a hands-on workshop where you will delve further into the advanced features for API lifecycle management that Apigee Edge has to offer. In this module, you will walk through three lab exercises that will help you...
* apply and manage shared policies for your API proxies 
* easily configure orchestration of services, to create a composite API proxy, and
* log API traffic to a loggin service, through built-in extensions on the platform.

We will also see, as part of a demo, the operational monitoring capabilities that Apigee provides for your API landscape.
